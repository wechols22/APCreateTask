# AP Computer Science Principles Create Task

This project is for the AP CSP Create Task. The project is simply a collection of python files to gauge progress. I would continue to use repl.it as a repository, but I have migrated my program to the PyCharm IDE for easier development; however, this means that I would have to tediously copy over files and directories to maintain my code with repl.it. Also, the addition of GUI elements were incompatible with a browser-based environment. 

## Current Development

Currently, the repository is primarily split between the main program in the main directory and the gui system in the gui-sys/ directory. My intention is to merge these programs to allow for the data structures and classes of the main program to be displayed and interacted with through the gui system.
